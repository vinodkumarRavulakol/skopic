                liability or incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. in such cases, skopic's liability will be<br />
                limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />

                2.Keep researching communities you are moderating, on the internet, social media and other traditional media so you are well informed to<br />
                moderate.

                3.Classify and organize the content most appropriately.<br />

                4.Get the best message out in 140 character Microblogs. Microblogging off long stories and articles is a powerful skill to develop and benefit your<br />
                communities.

                5. Keep the users’ interest going by keeping these communities live and current with positive activity.<br />

                6.Remove all the posts that are flagged abusive either instantly or periodically upon your discretion at the time.<br />

                7.If this is an invite only community, then please approve or reject user invitations in a timely manner.<br />

                8.Choose responsible and engaged members as additional moderators.<br />

                9.Periodically revisit the rules for users to post messages, because the very fact Skopic is a community sourced information network is defined<br />
                by how much your users are allowed or not allowed to post without any pre-approval.<br />

                Quick directions for driving user engagement and participation.<br />

                1.Add Questions and / or Answers (ASKs and SAYs to ASKs) on a periodic basis, at least 3 to 4 times a week.<br />

                2.Create TAGS for key issues, topics, activities or sub-groups and post related information, at least 10 to 15 posts per tag (spread it over 3 to 5<br />
                days).

                3.Try and create a new TAG in each community once in 5 to 7 days.<br />

                4. Post 1 UPDATE each community every day, the updates must not exceed 3 per day as it could be intimidating to users. Do not forget to add<br />
                community reminders if updates involve deadlines.<br />

                5.Post SAYs to Express thoughts or share knowledge. This is extremely critical to finding instant answers to the most pressing questions either<br />
                in the current time or in the future. Try and add at least 50 SAY messages for this category.<br />

                6.Always, review, reach out and encourage your, top 1o contributors, top 25 people in SAY and ASK categories which are listed on your<br />
                Community main page.<br />

                7.Most importantly remember that UPDATES and #TAGS when created are sent out to all the community interest, so these features stickiness<br />
                and user engagement.<br />

                8.Best of all, you understand your community the best, so your discretion may overrule some or all of these stated guidelines.<br />

                Thank You.<br />

                    In a world overflowing with selfies, Tweets, memes and an obsession for “likes,” is any of it really that valuable for the growth or stability of our<br />
                    communities? Data and knowledge are some of mankind’s greatest assets: they nearly act as our modern day currencies, yet we as social<br />
                    creatures remain fixated on hitting milestones regarding followers or subscribers when we have the potential to do so much with what we have at<br />
                    our fingertips. Skopic strives to empower our data-driven world through knowledge sharing, after all- knowledge is power.<br /><br />

                    I’m not saying we should all become Instagram influencers or quit our jobs to become public figures, but in order to create content and contribute<br />
                    to the knowledge base of your community, you just need to post on Skopic about subjects you already know and<br />
                    encourage your peers to do the same. Our world s evolving and a diversification or growth of our minds is something I believe we should strive<br />
                    for together: Skopic offers a place to share more than just pictures of our pets and friends, it offers a place for us to share what makes us<br />
                    uniquely human: knowledge.<br />

                    Skopic is an information networking platforming. Skopic focuses on content people care about in their local community. Users are able to post<br />
                    within their local geographical communities whether that be an educational institution or a non-profit organization like Lions Club of Santa Clara.<br />
                    My personal favorite aspect of Skopic is the ability to post alerts that offer real time information about the local community like when and where<br />
                    an event may be occurring. Skopic allows for real dialogue to happen within a community allowing people to ask questions and post statements<br />
                    within their community. Skopic brings user based information front and center rather than multimedia content meant to engage users with<br />
                    neighborhood related content.<br />
